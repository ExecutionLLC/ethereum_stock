Principles</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The following Terms (“Terms”) govern the "Contribution Procedure" to the AETERNITY Establishment, based in Liechtenstein (“ÆTERNITY”),  by Users (“Users” collectively, and “User” individually) and the subsequent allocation of transferable cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units called AE (“Æ”) to Users.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">ÆTERNITY, and any other supporting organization, will promote the development of open source software technology (“The Software”) that enables the creation of a scalable public decentralized cloud computing platform the public can use to run server applications </span><span class="T1">(“ÆTERNITY Network”). Operation of the ÆTERNITY Network involves transferable cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units called Æ. Æ is a participatory token that allows the holder to deploy and run software code, vote on network governance issues, and support operation of the network through mining.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">When ÆTERNITY judges that the Software has been sufficiently developed to allow the ÆTERNITY Network to be launched, ÆTERNITY will create the initial block (“Genesis State”) which will include allocations of Æ that are essential for the ÆTERNITY Blockchain to operate. The Genesis allocations of Æ will reflect early contributions towards the development and to support ÆTERNITY, made in two subsequent phases: The "First Contribution Phase" which ended on April 6th 2017, and the "Second Contribution Phase" which will begin at 13:05 GMT on May 29th, 2017 (the “Launch Date”) and end on 13:05 GMT June 19th, 2017 or six hours after $21,000,000 CHF worth of ETH and BTC has been received (“Contribution Cap”), whichever is earlier. However, since the ÆTERNITY Network will be operated by an independent community of miners around the world using the open sourced Software, the community can fork the code to create an alternate blockchain. Therefore, ÆTERNITY cannot guarantee to any party that the initial allocation of Æ would end up as the dominant blockchain when the ÆTERNITY Network is created.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The User understands and accepts that while the individuals and entities, including involved entities assigned to this task will make reasonable efforts to develop and complete the ÆTERNITY Network, it is possible that such development may fail and that the ÆTERNITY Network and any Æ will not be created, become useless and/or valueless due to technical, commercial, regulatory or any other reasons (see also Section</span><span class="T2"> 7</span><span class="T1"> regarding Risks).</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The User is also aware of the risk that even if all or parts of the ÆTERNITY Network are successfully developed and released in full or in parts, due to a lack of public interest, the ÆTERNITY Network could be fully or partially abandoned, remain unsuccessful according to any measure, or shut down for lack of interest or other reasons. The User therefore understands and accepts that the Contribution to ÆTERNITY, and/or the allocation, use and ownership of Æ, carries significant financial, regulatory and/or reputational risks (including the complete loss of value, if any, of Æ and attributed features).</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The User further confirms to have carefully reviewed the Terms and fully understands the risks and costs of making a Contribution to ÆTERNITY. By contributing to ÆTERNITY, the User expressly agrees to all of the terms and conditions set forth herein. ETH Contribution will be made to Ethereum addresses and Bitcoin to BTC address (as specified in Section 3.5). Contribution could also be made to a third party services approved by ÆTERNITY such as crowdfunding portals as further specified in Section 3.3. The management of contributions will be made in a multi signature approved by Key Holders (in a process specified in Section 3.5). The initial distribution of Æ token will be facilitated through a designated “Æ Contribution Contract” ("ACC") on the Ethereum blockchain and will reflect such collected Contributions (and per the allocation mechanism set forth in section 3.7.) ÆTERNITY shall distribute Æ </span>within four weeks after the Second Phase of the Contribution Campaign concludes, however <span class="T1">ÆTERNITY</span> reserves the right to delay delivery by up to 6 months after the conclusion of the Contribution Campaign, as a precautionary time period to ,resolve any arising issues such as security issues. <span class="T1">Following the conclusion</span><span class="T4"> </span><span class="T1">of both phases of ÆTERNITY Contribution Campaign, and after a development phase as described in the ÆTERNITY road map, ÆTERNITY will announce if the Software has been sufficiently developed to allow the ÆTERNITY blockchain to be launched. Upon a successful launch, ÆTERNITY will create the initial block ("Genesis Block") and allocate pre mined AE tokens in accordance to Users respective Æ allocation on the Ethereum blockchain (process further explained in Sections 3.7 and 4)</span><span class="T2">.</span><span class="T1"> Remaining Æ on the Ethereum blockchain will lose their functionality (and their intrinsic value), except for their credentials, the Private Keys ("PUK") that will be used to access a correspondent ÆTERNITY Address with an equivalent amount of Æ on the ÆTERNITY blockchain. </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1"> </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The User also understands and accepts that - as the allocation of Æ is based on Smart Contract Systems (Ethereum Smart Contract and the ACC) - the functions, terms and conditions applicable thereon are set forth therein. To the extent the terms contained herein or in any other document or communication contradict to the ones in the Smart Contract System; the terms of the Smart Contract prevail. Furthermore, no other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or covenants to ÆTERNITY beyond those set forth in this document and the Smart Contract Systems.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">This document does not constitute a prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.

The purpose of this limitation is to ensure broad, global participation in the Contribution Campaign. For the purpose of measuring the </span><span class="T1">maximum Contribution per one individual, ÆTERNITY will use the BTC/CHF and ETH/CHF exchange rate as provided by CoinMarketCap or equivalent service chosen by ÆTERNITY. Any individual, group, corporation, company, entity, or groups of legally connected entities (e.g., multiple entities with the same owner, or multiple entities in which one owns one or more of the others, or multiple entities who have entered into a joint venture) wishing to obtain more than the cap amount Æ must contact ÆTERNITY directly to clear the purchase.

The time that it takes for the ACC to create the Æ Allocation Units, an ERC-20 compatible token on Ethereum blockchain, depends upon mechanisms inside the ACC and other technology used to collect and track Contributions. The initial distribution </span>will occur within four weeks after the Second Phase of the Contribution Campaign concludes, however <span class="T1">ÆTERNITY</span> reserves the right to delay delivery by up to six months after the conclusion of the Contribution Campaign as a precautionary time period to resolve any arising issues such as security issues<span class="T6">.</span><span class="T2"> </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">When ÆTERNITY judges that the Software has been sufficiently developed to allow the ÆTERNITY blockchain to be launched, ÆTERNITY will create the initial block ("Genesis Block"), and allocate pre mined Æ tokens to the User in accordance to the ACC respective Æ Allocation Units existing on the Ethereum blockchain (as further described in Section 4). </span><span class="T1">At that point all Æ tokens on the Ethereum blockchain will lose their intrinsic value, and only their credentials can be used to access a correspondent address on ÆTERNITY blockchain which will hold equivalent amount of Æ. </span>If User decides not to migrate to <span class="T1">ÆTERNITY blockchain</span>, he may no longer use his <span class="T1">Æ </span>as any <span class="T1">Æ left on the Ethereum blockchain </span>may lose their functionality in full.</p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">In order to participate in the Contribution Procedure, you will need to have an ÆTERNITY account created on an Ethereum address using an open source wallet provider (which can be found on aeternity.com), or you can also directly contribute from any Ethereum or Bitcoin Wallet which you hold your own PUK (e.g. Myetherwallet, not a digital currency exchange). </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">For your security, when you login or register on ÆTERNITY, you must do it from your private computer using a private network, from a private physical location. </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Account Seed - During your ÆTERNITY wallet creation a Private Key ("PUK") will be generated and you will be required to choose a strong password and download a keystore file. Please follow the instructions and read carefully all ÆTERNITY posts and related tutorials. If you choose to send from a different wallet, please be reminded that a “seed phrase” sometime used to create an address and corresponding private key. Private Keys (or the Seed Phrase/Keyphrase) are the only way you can access your "ÆTERNITY Account" and therefore your Æ tokens. By participating in the "Æternity Contribution Campaign", you understand and agree that you are responsible for safeguarding the "PUK" and that: </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">• You must write down the PUK on piece of paper and safeguard the paper at all times beyond at least 2 separate physical locking devices, e.g. a fire &amp; water resistant safe and a door. • You must never share the PUK with anyone. • You understand that if someone gets the PUK, by any means, they gain full access to your Æ • You understand that Æ does not store the PUK and cannot recover it if lost. • If you lose the PUK, you will lose access to your Æ forever. The User only uses an address for the Contribution that is supported by ÆTERNITY Contribution Campaign and does not send any Contribution directly from an exchange • User understands and accepts that failure to assure this may have the result that User will not gain access to his or her Æ. </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">3.6 Contribution Rewards </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Æ will be rewarded for Contributions and delivered by the ACC initially on the Ethereum blockchain, until the migration to the ÆTERNITY blockchain (as described above in Section 3.5).

ACC will set the allocations of Æ according to the principles set forth below and under Section 3.5 above:</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Pool A: 82% of the “Total Æ Amount” allocated by the Genesis State shall be allocated to Users who made Contributions to ÆTERNITY during the Contribution Periods. </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Pool B: 8.5% of the Total Æ Amount shall be reserved for an allocation (an endowment) to be used at the complete discretion of ÆTERNITY, for funding operations, disbursement of grants to developers, education, further research and community outreach.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Pool C: 8.5% of the Total Æ Amount shall be allocated to the team members and partners who made early financial or development contributions or provided other support or resources that were needed to realize the current design of the ÆTERNITY. The Æ allocated to core team members of ÆTERNITY will be time locked and will be released over a 2 year time frame in order to incentivise their long term involvement in ÆTERNITY.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Pool D – 1% will be distributed at the launch of ÆTERNITY blockchain to Bitcoin and Ethereum holders according</span><span class="T4"> </span><span class="T1">to a certain algorithm and/or criteria to be published by ÆTERNITY. ÆTERNITY reserve the right to modify the distribution method of Pool D.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Pool E: Total of 1,000,000 (1 million) Æ to early supporters who contributed to the ÆTERNITY bounty campaign (Æ Bounties). Æ Bounties will be manually approved and delivered at the end of the Contribution Periods. ÆTERNITY may start additional bounties campaigns at its sole discretion. Æ Bounties are not entitled to time or amount contribution bonuses. Participants who were approved shall have their registered “Æ Accounts” credited to receive allocated Æ. Æ Bounties that were not been claimed during 2 months period following the end of the Contribution Campaign will be destroyed or reallocated at ÆTERNITY discretion for the benefit of ÆTERNITY community.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">4. Æternity Genesis Block</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">4.1 When ÆTERNITY judges in its sole discretion both that The Software is sufficiently developed to launch the ÆTERNITY Network and that it is a good time to launch, it will create and place in a pre-mining process, a sum of Æ in the Genesis Block of the blockchain used for the Æternity Network. The exact amount shall be equivalent to the recorded ACC token distribution and will include in the Genesis Block an equivalent size to pools mentioned above (Section 3.7). </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The Genesis Block is expected to be created during the following 12-18 months after the Contribution Periods, although there are no guarantees that this will occur according to such </span><span class="T1">a time-frame or at all. Users may claim their Æ on the ÆTERNITY blockchain after such time by taking control with their assigned Æ credentials (exact instructions will be published beforehand on aeternity.com). Immediately after the creation of the Genesis Block, Æ's left on the Ethereum blockchain will lose all intrinsic value and only their credentials could be used to access a correspondent ÆTERNITY Address, which will hold an equivalent amount of newly formed Æ. </span>If User decides not to take part in the migration process to the <span class="T1">ÆTERNITY blockchain</span>, he may no longer use his <span class="T1">Æ </span>and that <span class="T1">Æ left on the Ethereum blockchain </span>may lose their functionality in full.</p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">4.2 Growth Rate of Æ</span><span class="T4">  </span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Once the Æternity blockchain is operational, new Æ is expected to be spontaneously created at a constant annual linear rate exclusively via the mining process pursuant to a target annual rate. The ongoing mining process secures the Æternity blockchain and Æ will be created by the protocol as a reward to miners. The annual target rate of new Æ creation will be set to:</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">                - 20% of the Genesis Blockchain's Æ in first year; afterwards -</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">                - 10% in second year</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">                - 5 % in third year</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">                - 3 % in fourth year</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">                - 0% inflation</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">For technical reasons Æ may need to change the annual rate of new creation for changes to the Æternity mining algorithm or to address other issues that may arise. Although Æ does not intend to change the annual rate of new creation at this time, there is no guarantee that the percentage will be accurate or that this rate will continue at the same level. </span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">5. ÆTERNITY Project Execution</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">ÆTERNITY has the right to engage subcontractors to perform the entire or partial development and execution of the ÆTERNITY Project.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">It remains at ÆTERNITY's sole discretion to decide how to allocate the Contributions received in order to develop and execute the ÆTERNITY Project.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The User understands and accepts that he may not have any expectation of influence over governance on ÆTERNITY.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The User understands and accepts that the ÆTERNITY Network will need to go through substantial development works as part of which it may become subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The User acknowledges and understands that after the ÆTERNITY Blockchain launch Users will have the discretion whether or not to adopt the smart contract proposals of ÆTERNITY and the functionality of Æ as deployed by ÆTERNITY. The User acknowledges and understands that ÆTERNITY may not warrant or assure that the Users will not change the functionality of the Æ and/or of the ÆTERNITY Platform as proposed by ÆTERNITY (and set forth herein) and that such conduct could have the consequence that Æ become useless and/or valueless (see also Section 7 regarding risks).</span></p><p class="P2"/><p class="P1"><span class="T1">6. Technical Checks of the Smart Contract System</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The Smart Contract System used to facilitate the Contribution Campaign has been, on a reasonable effort basis, examined by technical experts with regard to their functionality. The technical experts have confirmed that the Smart Contract System has, with regard to both accuracy and security, been programmed according to the current state of the art.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">However, the User understands and accepts that the used software and technology is still in an early development stage and its application of experimental nature which carries significant operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks. Accordingly, while the examinations performed raise the level of security and accuracy, the User understands and accepts that such examinations do not amount to any form of warranty, including direct or indirect warranties that the Smart Contract Systems are fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which could cause, inter alia, the complete loss of ETH, BTC and Æ.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">7. Risks</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">The User understands and accepts the risks in connection with the Contribution to ÆTERNITY, and/or with the allocation, use and ownership of Æ, as exemplary set forth above and hereinafter. In particular, but not concluding, the User understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter:</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Risk of software weaknesses: The User understands and accepts that the decentralized cloud concept, The ÆTERNITY Network, Smart Contract Systems including the ACC and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories (including but not limited to blockchains, Validation Trees, cryptography and game theoretic assumptions related to Proof of Stake networks)</span><span class="T2"> </span><span class="T1">are still in an early development stage and unproven, there is no warranty that the process for receiving, use and ownership of Æ will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of Æ.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Regulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the setup of the Smart Contract Systems and decentralized cloud concept and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the decentralized cloud concept and/or the ÆTERNITY Network, including its termination and the loss of Æ for the User.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The User understands and accepts that the allocation of the Æ and the development of the ÆTERNITY Network may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from industry and/or the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). The User therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if the ÆTERNITY Network </span><span class="T1">is partially or fully developed and launched, the User will receive any functionality through the Æ held by him.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Risk associated with other applications: The User understands and accepts that the ÆTERNITY Network may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which Æ will have no intrinsic value.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Risk of loss of private key: Æ may only be accessed using a private key that corresponds to the address at which it is stored. User understands and accepts that if his private key, or the “seed” used to create his address and corresponding private key got lost or stolen, the obtained Æ associated with the User’s address will be unrecoverable and will be permanently lost.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Risk of theft: The User understands and accepts that the decentralized cloud concept, the Smart Contract Systems, The Software, the virtual platform created by the ÆTERNITY Network, the Ethereum network, the ACC smart contract hosted on Ethereum, and other technology components or platforms may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that that could result in theft or loss of Æ, or the theft or loss of Contributions, impacting the ability to develop and launch the ÆTERNITY Network.</span></p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">Risk of blockchain mining attacks: The User understands and accepts that, as with other public blockchain based systems that depend upon independent miners, the ÆTERNITY Network may be susceptible to mining attacks including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the decentralized cloud system created by the ÆTERNITY Network, expected proper execution and sequencing of Æ transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of software computations.</span></p><p class="P2"> </p><p class="P1"><span class="T1">8.
